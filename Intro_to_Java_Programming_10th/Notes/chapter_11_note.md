### Note 11.2.N1 Inheritance Notification
  
■ A subclass is not a subset of its superclass. In fact, a subclass usually contains more information and methods than its superclass.  
  
■ Private data fields in a superclass are not accessible outside the class. They can be accessed/mutated through public accessors/mutators if defined in the superclass.
  
■ Not all is-a relationships should be modeled using inheritance.  
  
■ Inheritance is used to model the is-a relationship. A subclass and its superclass must have the is-a relationship.  
  
■ Java does not allow multiple inheritance. A Java class may inherit directly from only one superclass. This restriction is known as single inheritance. (multiple inheritance can be
achieved through interfaces)
